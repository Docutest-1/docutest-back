# docutest-back

Docutest is a web application that is used to run load tests on web applications based on Swagger files 
submitted to the application. Once load tests are complete, Docutest then returns a graphical representation 
of the results. Any tests results are stored in a database, and can be retrieved as soon as the load tests complete, 
as well as can be retrieved at any point in the future
